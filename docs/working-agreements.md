# Team Working Agreements

This document outlines our team's communication norms and agreements.

## Part A: Activity 1 - Communication Norms

### 1. Channels

- All official decisions and technical discussions will be documented in GitHub Issues or the relevant Pull Request.
- MS Teams will be used for quick, informal chats and clarifications.

### 2. Response Times

- Team members will acknowledge direct messages or requests within 24 hours during the week.
- Urgent matters requiring immediate attention should be sent via MS Teams @mention.

### 3. Meeting Etiquette

- All meetings will begin and end on time.
- An agenda will be circulated at least one hour before the meeting, and all members are expected to have reviewed it.

### 4. Pull Request (PR) Tone

- Feedback on PRs will be constructive and focus on the code and ideas, not the individual.
- We will use a respectful tone, and all reviews must include at least one positive comment or acknowledgment of the work done.
