# <Risks and Constraints>
## The challenges that we might encounter during the project
This program might not work properly due to its dependency on manual input, so if there is an error made by the user's end, it would affect the program.
## Content
- Difficult to organize who needs to pay and who has already paid their share of the expense
- Manual calculations for percentage-based or custom splits are error-prone and time-consuming.
- If there is an input that was missing or wrong, the result of the calculations would be incorrect.
